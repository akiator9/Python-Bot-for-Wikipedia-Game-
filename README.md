Traverse from random Wikipedia to some Target Wikipedia page using Random HyperLinks only. 
Tradition WikiRace has been described by the Wikipedia as following:

**A Wikirace (IPA: /ˈwɪ.ki.rɛɪs/) is a race between any number of participants, using links to travel from one Wikipedia page to another. The first person to reach the destination page, or the person that reaches the destination using the fewest links, wins the race. **

This program is a modification of this race.In this we try to reach the destination page using random links only.An interesting aspect of this program is just to see where all our bot wanders in search of some destination page.
